# Hello World: Starting My Technical Blog

Welcome! I'm Mayank, a Software Development Engineer working on building scalable backend services and high-performance data infrastructure. After years of learning, building, and occasionally breaking things in production, I've decided to start documenting my journey.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover topics I work with daily:

- **Backend Engineering**: API design, performance optimization, and building reliable services
- **Distributed Systems**: Lessons from working with Kafka, distributed databases, and microservices
- **Database Internals**: PostgreSQL optimization, ClickHouse for analytics, and choosing the right tool for the job
- **System Design**: Approaching problems at scale, trade-offs, and real-world patterns

## Why Write?

Writing helps me think more clearly about the problems I solve. It forces me to understand concepts deeply enough to explain them. And if my experiences help someone else avoid a production incident or discover a better approach, that's a win.

## A Bit About My Work

Currently at Juspay, I work on payment systems processing millions of transactions. Some highlights:

- Building APIs with sub-100ms response times
- Designing ETL pipelines that process 10,000+ events per second
- Working with ClickHouse for real-time analytics
- Reducing data latency through Kafka integration

Each of these has taught me something worth sharing.

## What's Next

I'm planning to start with some practical topics:

1. Optimizing PostgreSQL queries for high-throughput systems
2. Setting up ClickHouse clusters for production workloads
3. Lessons from building real-time analytics platforms

Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out if there's something specific you'd like me to write about!
